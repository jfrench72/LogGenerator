# summary

This provides a simple Deployment YAML file that can be used to make use of the docker image generated by [../Docker] and held in DockerHub.  Out of the box there is no configuration overrrides in place.  The easiest way to achieve the overrides is to replace the existing configuration and data files by either using the shared mount point or a ConfigMap  

## Application
This can be used to help verify Docker log driver and Logging Daemonset configurations.
